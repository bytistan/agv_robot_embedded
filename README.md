# AGV Robot Embedded System

This repository contains the embedded system software for an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) robot. The AGV robot is designed to autonomously navigate and transport goods in controlled environments such as warehouses, factories, or logistics centers.

## Features

- **Autonomous Navigation:** The AGV robot can move without human intervention, avoiding obstacles and following predefined paths.
- **Sensor Integration:** Multiple sensors are used for environment detection and path planning.
- **Motor Control:** Efficient motor control algorithms ensure smooth and precise movement of the robot.
- **Real-time Data Processing:** The system processes sensor data in real-time to make navigation decisions.
- **Modular Design:** The software is designed in a modular fashion, allowing easy updates and improvements.

## Project Structure

- **/robot:** Contains the source code for the embedded system, including drivers, sensor handling, and control algorithms.
  
## System Overview

The AGV robot system is built using a microcontroller to manage various tasks, including sensor data acquisition, motor control, and communication with external devices. Key components include:

- **Microcontroller:** The heart of the system, responsible for executing control logic.
- **Sensors:** Used to detect obstacles, measure distances, and ensure safe navigation.
- **Motors:** Controlled by pulse-width modulation (PWM) to drive the robot forward and steer.
- **Communication Module:** Enables communication between the AGV robot and external systems.
